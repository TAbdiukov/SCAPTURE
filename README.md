![oooOOOooo](icons8-third-eye-symbol-64.png)Simple capturing tool for legacy/crazy systems

## Compat
* Runs on everything made by microsoft and having a 8086-compatible processor
	* Made for systems not supporting capturing software for whatever reason (like embedded systems)

## Features
* **Takes into consideration how weird the windows programming is**
	* Yet doesm't use any winapi
* Not too crazy

* The slight limitation is, tool saves in `.bmp` only. PNG/other lossless formats require winapi/3rd party classes, which is probably too much

## Usage

* Run the tool, make sure the status is ON
* Press `printscreen`
* Get your sweet pics in the directory

## Credits
* Third Eye Symbol icon icon by Icons8
