Simple capturing tool for legacy/crazy systems

## Compat
* Runs on everything made by microsoft and having a 8086-compatible processor
	* Made for systems not supporting capturing software for whatever reason (like embedded systems)

## Features
* **Takes into consideration how weird the windows programming is**
	* Doesn't use any external WinApi
	* The slight limitation, tool saves in `.bmp` only. 
		PNG/other lossless formats require winapi/3rd party classes, which is probably too much

* Not too crazy


## Usage

* Run the tool, make sure the status is ON
* Press `Printscreen`
* Get your sweet pics in the directory
